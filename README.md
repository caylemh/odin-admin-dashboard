## My process

I first began with the HTML skeleton for the project and then proceeded to implement the CSS styles for the final look and outcome.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Using HTML, CSS Grid and Flexbox where applicable to create an efficient dashboard design. Responsive layout wil be ignored for the current project at this stage.

### Continued development

To eventually make the design:
- Responsive
- Perhaps tablet ready (Due to screen real estate)
- Javascript functionality
